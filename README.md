# Silex Mongo Skeleton

This is a basic template for quickly setting up a Silex project using MongoDB and a few other plugins.
I created project for personal use as I found myself repeating a lot of code, but anyone is free to use it.


## Installation

	composer create-project marcqualie/silex-mongo-skeleton
